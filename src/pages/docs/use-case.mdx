# Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram allows us to describe the possible usage scenarios 
(use cases) that a system is developed for. It expresses what a system
should do but does not address any realization details such as data structures,
algorithms, etc. These details are covered by other diagrams such
as the class diagram or the interaction diagrams. The use case diagram also models which user of the system
uses which functionality, i.e., it expresses who will actually work with
the system to be built.

1. What is being described? (The system.)
2. Who interacts with the system? (The actors.)
3. What can the actors do? (The use cases.)

## Use cases
A use case describes functionality expected from the system to be developed. It encompasses a number of functions that are executed when
using this system. A use case provides a tangible benefit for one or more
actors that communicate with this use case. The use case diagram does
not cover the internal structure and the actual implementation of a use
case. In general, a use case is triggered either by invocation of an actor
or by a trigger event, in short, a trigger. An example of a trigger is that
the semester has ended and hence the use case Issue certificate must be
executed.

## Actors
To describe a system completely, it is essential to document not only
what the system can do but also who actually works and interacts with
the system. In the use case diagram, actors always interact with the system in the context of their use cases, that is, the use cases with which
they are associated.
An actor interacts with the system by using the system as an active actor, meaning that the actor initiates the execution of use cases;
alternatively, the interaction involves the actor being used by the system,
meaning that the actor is a passive actor providing functionality
for the execution of use cases.
## Associations
An actor is connected
with the use cases via associations which express that the actor communicates with the system and uses a certain functionality. Every actor
must communicate with at least one use case. Otherwise, we would have
an actor that does not interact with the system. In the same way, every
use case must be in a relationship with at least one actor. If this were
not the case, we would have modeled a functionality that is not used by
anyone and is therefore irrelevant.
An association is always binary, meaning that it is always specified
between one use case and one actor.Multiplicities may be specified
for the association ends. If a multiplicity greater than 1 is specified for
the actor’s association end, this means that more than one instance of
an actor is involved in the execution of the use case.
### Relationships between Actors
The use of abstract actors only makes sense in the context of an inheritance
relationship: the common properties of the sub-actors are grouped
and described at one point, namely with the common, abstract superactor.
Generalization is a fundamental concept of object orientation and
can be applied to many different language elements of UML.
### Relationships between Use cases
Use cases can also be in a relationship with other use
cases. Here we differentiate between «include» relationships, «extend»
relationships, and generalizations of use cases.
The base use case always requires
the behavior of the included use case to be able to offer its functionality.
In contrast, the included use case can be executed on its own. The
use of **«include»** is analogous to calling a subroutine in a procedural
programming language.
- An **«extend»** relationship is shown with a dashed arrow from the extending use case B to the base use case A. Both use cases can also be
executed independently of one another.
- A **condition** that must be fulfilled for the base use case to insert the Condition
behavior of the extending use case can be specified for every «extend»
relationship. The condition is specified, within curly brackets, in a note
that is connected with the corresponding «extend» relationship.
- By using **extension** points, you can define the point at which the be- Extension point
havior of the extending use cases must be inserted in the base use case.
The extension points are written directly within the use case

## Creating a Use Case Diagram
### Identifying Actors and Use Cases
there are two ways to identify use cases for prospective
system design:
1. Analysis of requirements documents
2. Analysis of the expectations of future users
#### Questions for identifying actors
- Who uses the main use cases? 
- Who needs support for their daily work? 
- Who is responsible for system administration?
- What are the external devices/(software) systems with which the system
must communicate?
- Who has an interest in the results of the system?
#### Questions for identifying use cases
- What are the main tasks that an actor must perform? 
- Does an actor want to query or even modify information contained
in the system?
- Does an actor want to inform the system about changes in other systems?
- Should an actor be informed about unexpected events within the system?

## Summary
The use case diagram describes the behavior of a system from the view
of the user. This means that this diagram presents the functionalities
that the system offers but does not address the internal implementation
details. The boundaries of the system—what can the system do and
what can it not do?—are clearly defined. The users (actors) are always
outside the system and use the functionalities of the system, which are
depicted in the form of use cases. The relationship between a use case
and an actor is referred to as an association. To keep use case diagrams
as compact as possible, generalization is supported for both actors and
use cases, which allows the extraction of common properties. Use cases
can also access the functionality provided by other use cases by means
of «include» and «extend» relationships.
