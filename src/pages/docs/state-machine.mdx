# State machine
___
Over the course of its life, every system, or to be more precise every
object, goes through a finite number of different states. Using a ***state machine diagram***, 
you can model the possible states for the system or object in question, how state transitions 
occur as a consequence of occurring events, and what behavior the system or object exhibits in each
state.

In the same way as every other diagram, a state machine diagram
only models the part of a system that is necessary or relevant for the
respective purpose.
___

### States and States transitions
A state machine diagram is a graph with states as nodes and state 
transitions as edges. In the diagram, a state is shown as a rectangle with
round corners and is labeled with the name of the state. When an object
is in a specific state, all internal activities specified in this state can be
executed by this object.
#### Internal activities
Within a state you can model three activities that are executed at
a predefined moment. When an activity is specified after the keyword
entry, this activity must then be executed when the object enters the
state; conversely, the exit activity is executed when the object exits the
state. An activity preceded by the keyword do is executed while the
object remains in this state, that is, as long as this state is active. The
respective activity is always specified with a prepended forward slash
that clearly identifies it as an activity.

The change from one state to another is referred to as a state transition
or simply transition.
The origin of the transition is referred to as the source state and
the end of the transition is referred to as the target state. You can specify
various properties for a transition:
- The event (also called “trigger”) that triggers the state transition
- The guard (also called “guard condition” or simply “condition”) that
enables the execution of the transition
- Activities (also called “effects”) executed during the change to the
target state.
#### Event (Trigger)
Events are exogenous stimuli (that is, stimuli that come from outside 
the system/object) that can trigger a state transition.
#### Guard (condition)
If the event specified for the transition occurs, the guard is checked. 
The guard is a boolean expression. At a specific point in time, it 
evaluates to either true or false.
#### Activity (Effect)
If the guard is true, all activities in the current state
are terminated, any relevant exit activity is executed, and the transition
takes place. During the state transition, any activities defined for 
that transition are executed. A transition—at least from a conceptual
perspective—requires no time. Therefore, the system is always in a state
and never in a transition. The activities specified for a transition must
therefore also not require any significant time.
#### Completion event and Completion transition 
Finishing these activities creates a ***completion event*** that triggers the
transition. This type of transition is also referred to as a ***completion transition***. 
If an event occurs for which no behavior is specified in the
current state, the event is not consumed and is lost.

You can model internal transitions within states. These internal transitions 
handle the occurrence of events within a state. You use them to
model the reaction to an event when the system does not exit the state
that is currently active, meaning that entry and exit activities are not executed.
___
## Types of States 
There is a distinction between ***“real” states*** and ***pseudostates***. 
Pseudostates are transient, which means that the system cannot 
remain in a pseudostate. They are not states in the actual sense but rather
control structures that enable more complex states and state transitions.
You cannot annotate activities to pseudostates. These pseudostates include
the initial state, the decision node, the parallelization and synchronization
nodes, the history state, the entry and exit points, and the
terminate node.

#### Initial state
The initial state is represented in the diagram as a small black circle
and marks the “start” of a state machine diagram or a composite state.
#### Decision node
The decision node is represented in the diagram with a diamond. You
can use it to model alternative transitions. It has exactly one incoming
edge and at least two outgoing edges. At the incoming edge, you model
the event that triggers the transition; at the outgoing edges, you specify
the guards for the alternative paths for the state transition.
