# 2. diagrams

In UML, a model is represented graphically in the form of diagrams. A Diagram
diagram provides a view of that part of reality described by the model.
There are diagrams that express which users use which functionality
and diagrams that show the structure of the system but without specifying
a concrete implementation. There are also diagrams that represent
supported and forbidden processes. In the current version 2.4.1, UML
offers 14 diagrams that describe either the structure or the behavior of a
system.

## 2.1 Structure Diagrams
UML offers seven types of diagrams for modeling the structure of a system
from different perspectives. The dynamic behavior of the elements
in question (i.e., their changes over time) is not considered in these diagrams.
### The Class Diagram
Just like the concepts of the object diagram (see next paragraph),
concepts of the class diagram originate from conceptual data modeling
and object-oriented software development. These concepts are used
to specify the data structures and object structures of a system. The
class diagram is based primarily on the concepts of class, generalization,
and association. For example, in a class diagram, you can model
that the classes Course, Student, and Professor occur in a system. Professors
teach courses and students attend courses. Students and professors
have common properties as they are both members of the class Person.
This is expressed by a generalization relationship.

### The Object Diagram
Based on the definitions of the related class diagram, an object dia-
gram shows a concrete snapshot of the system state at a specific execution
time. For example, an object diagram could show that a professor
Henry Foster (henryFoster) teaches the courses Object-Oriented Modeling
(oom) and Object-Oriented Programming (oop).

#### The Package Diagram
The package diagram groups diagrams or model elements according toThe package diagram groups diagrams or model elements according to
common properties, such as functional cohesion. For example, in a university
administration system, you could introduce packages that contain
information about the teaching, the research, and the administrative
aspects. Packages are often integrated in other diagrams rather than being
shown in separate diagrams.

#### The Component Diagram
UML pays homage to component-oriented software development by offering component diagrams. A component is an independent, executable
unit that provides other components with services or uses the
services of other components. UML does not prescribe any strict separation
between object-oriented and component-oriented concepts. Indeed,
these concepts may be combined in any way required. When specifying
a component, you can model two views explicitly: the external view
(black box view), which represents the specification of the component,
and the internal view (white box view), which defines the implementation
of the component.
#### The Composition Structure Diagram
The composition structure diagram allows a hierarchical decomposition
of the parts of the system. You can therefore use a composition structure
diagram to describe the internal structure of classes or components
in detail. This enables you to achieve a higher level of detail than, for
example, in a class diagram because the modeling is context-specific.
You can specify details of the internal structure that are valid precisely
for the context under consideration.
#### The Deployment Diagram
The hardware topology used and the runtime system assigned can be
represented by the deployment diagram. The hardware encompasses
processing units in the form of nodes as well as communication relationships
between the nodes. A runtime system contains artifacts that
are deployed to the nodes.
#### The Profile Diagram
Using profiles, you can extend UML to introduce domain-specific con-
cepts. The actual core of the language definition of UML, the metamodel,
remains unchanged. You can thus reuse modeling tools without
having to make adjustments. For example, you can use profiles to introduce
the concept of Java Enterprise Beans.
### 2.3.2 Behavior Diagrams
With the behavior diagrams, UML offers the infrastructure that enables
you to define behavior in detail.
Behavior refers to the direct consequences of an action of at least one
object. It affects how the states of objects change over time. Behavior
can either be specified through the actions of a single object or result
from interactions between multiple objects.
#### Use Case Diagram
UML offers the use case diagram to enable you to define the require-
ments that a system must fulfill. This diagram describes which users use
which functionalities of the system but does not address specific details
of the implementation. The units of functionality that the system provides
for its users are called use cases. In a university administration
system, for example, the functionality Registration would be a use case
used by students.
#### The State Machine Diagram
Within their life cycle, objects go through different states. For example,
a person is in the state logged out when first visiting a website. The state
changes to logged in after the person successfully entered username and
password (event login). As soon as the person logs out (event logout), the
person returns to the state logged out. This behavior can be represented
in UML using the state machine diagram. This diagram describes the
permissible behavior of an object in the form of possible states and state
transitions triggered by various events.
#### The Activity Diagram
You can model processes of any kind using activity diagrams: both busi-
ness processes and software processes. For example, an activity diagram
can show which actions are necessary for a student to participate in a
lecture and an assignment. Activity diagrams offer control flow mechanisms
as well as data flow mechanisms that coordinate the actions that
make up an activity, that is, a process.
#### The Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram describes the interactions between objects to ful-
fill a specific task, for example, registration for an exam in a university
administration system. The focus is on the chronological order of
the messages exchanged between the interaction partners. Various constructs
for controlling the chronological order of the messages as well as
concepts for modularization allow you to model complex interactions.
#### The Communication Diagram
Similarly to the sequence diagram, the communication diagram de-
scribes the communication between different objects. Here, the focus
is on the communication relationships between the interaction partners
rather than on the chronological order of the message exchange. Complex
control structures are not available. This diagram clearly shows
who interacts with whom.
#### The Timing Diagram
The timing diagram explicitly shows the state changes of the interaction
partners that can occur due to time events or as a result of the exchange
of messages. For example, a person is in the state logged in as soon as
the message is received from the university administration system that
the password sent is valid.
#### The Interaction Overview Diagram
The interaction overview diagram models the connection between dif-ferent interaction processes by setting individual interaction diagrams
(i.e., sequence diagram, communication diagram, timing diagram, and
other interaction overview diagrams) in a time-based and causal sequence.
It also specifies conditions under which interaction processes
are permitted to take place. To model the control flow, concepts from
the activity diagram are used. For example, a user of the university administration
system must first log in (which already represents a separate
interaction with the system) before being allowed to use further
functionalities.
